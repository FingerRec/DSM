The source code for paper [Enhancing Unsupervised Video Representation Learning by Decoupling the Scene and the Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05757.pdf)

__Datasets list and some visualizations/provided weights are preparing now.__

## 1. Introduction (*scene-dominated* to *motion-dominated*)

![](figures/ppl.png)
> Video datasets are usually scene-dominated, We propose to decouple the scene and the motion (DSM) with two simple operations, so that the model attention towards the motion information is better paid. 

The generated triplet is as below:

###  What DSM learned?

**With DSM pretrain, the model learn to focus on motion region (Not necessarily actor) powerful without one label available.**

#### DSM(Triplet)/DSM/Random
#### Self-supervised Pretrain
##### Kinetics
```bash
bash scripts/kinetics/pt.sh
```
##### UCF101
```bash
bash scripts/ucf101/pt.sh
```
#### Supervised Finetune (Clip-level)
##### HMDB51
```bash
bash scripts/hmdb51/ft.sh
```
##### UCF101
```bash
bash scripts/ucf101/ft.sh
```
##### Kinetics
```bash
bash scripts/kinetics/ft.sh
```

#### Video-level Evaluation
Following common practice [TSN](https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks) and [Non-local](https://github.com/facebookresearch/video-nonlocal-net).
The final video-level result is average by 10 temporal window sampling + corner crop, which lead to better result than clip-level.
Refer test.py for details.


#### Pretrain And Eval In one step
```bash
bash scripts/hmdb51/pt_and_ft_hmdb51.sh
```

**Notice: More Training Options and ablation study Can be find in scripts**

### Video Retrieve and other visualization

#### (1). Feature Extractor
As STCR can be easily extend to other video representation task, we offer the scripts to perform feature extract.
```bash
python feature_extractor.py
```

The feature will be saved as a single numpy file in the format [video_nums,features_dim] for further visualization.

#### (2). Reterival Evaluation
modify line60-line62 in reterival.py.
```bash
python reterival.py
```
